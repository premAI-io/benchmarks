[DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) by Microsoft is a library that helps us to do scalable training and inference across multiple GPUs and nodes. In this implementation we are using a library called [DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII), written on top of DeepSpeed. It uses four key technologies to speed up the inference, viz Blocked KV Caching, Continuous Batching, Dynamic SplitFuse and High Performance CUDA Kernels. To learn more about DeepSpeed-MII, check out there detailed [blogpost](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/tree/master/blogs/deepspeed-fastgen).


## ðŸš€ Running the DeepSpeed Benchmark.

We can run the DeepSpeed benchmark for two models: [Llama2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) and [Mistral-7B v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) Here is how we run benchmark for DeepSpeed.

```bash
./bench_deepspeed/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_deepspeed/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_deepspeed/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).


## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note. we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output in other three precisions, i.e. `float16`, `int8` and `int4`. This is our system prompt.

> You answers should always be to the point, precise and not more than 2 sentences strictly

| You are an expert on agricultural chemical compounds. Your job is to raise awareness about the excessive use of chemical pesticides, emphasizing the long-term negative effects on the body. Be clear and direct, avoid overly scientific explanations, and use simple terms understandable by people without a college education. Answer as much precise as possible with one sentence.                                        | Excessive use of chemical pesticides can have long-term negative effects on the body, including cancer, hormone disruption, and neurological problems, due to their toxic and persistent nature, which can accumulate in the body over time and cause irreversible damage. It is important to adopt sustainable and organic farming practices that prioritize the health of both people and the environment, such as crop rotation, composting, and integrated pest management, to minimize the use of harmful chemicals and promote a healthier | Excessive use of chemical pesticides can have long-term negative effects on the body, including cancer, hormone disruption, and neurological problems, due to their toxic and persistent nature, which can accumulate in the body over time and cause irreversible damage.

| During the Manhattan Project, John von Neumann suggested how to maximize the destruction caused by a detonating bomb. Which was his idea?

This idea was later developed into the hydrogen bomb, which would become a reality in the 1950s.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction through the simultaneous detonation of a fission bomb and a fusion reaction, creating a chain reaction of nuclear reactions that would release an enormous amount of energy.

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. Running this benchmark requires [HuggingFace Llama2-7B weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b). So running this benchmark would assume that you already agreed to the required [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and got verified to download the weights.
2. DeepSpeed-MII is designed to run on CUDA. So by default it does not support for Metal or CPU devices.
3. Since we run the benchmark for only LLama2-7B model. And for this implementation, DeepSpeed-MII [only supports](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/b81bed69a8db3c1e3263c27f48dcecf12b354931/deepspeed/inference/v2/model_implementations/llama_v2/model.py#L83) Float16 precision.
4. Current implementation of DeepSpeed-MII [does not support](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed-MII/issues/255) Quantized models. So INT4/8 benchmarking is not available.
