The implementation of benchmarking [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) uses the [Transformers Library by Huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) under the hood. The reason being, Transformers provides an easy to use interface for Llama-2-7B model in PyTorch backend.


## 🚀 Running the PyTorch Benchmark.

We can run the PyTorch benchmark for two models: [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) and [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) Here is how we run benchmark for PyTorch.

```bash
./bench_pytorch/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_pytorch/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_pytorch/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).


## 💎 Quality Checks

Please note, this benchmark is using HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend). We consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) weights as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output in other three precisions, i.e. `float16`, `int8` and `int4`. This is our system prompt.

## 👀 Some points to note:

1. Running this benchmark specifically when `--model` is Llama 2 7B Chat, requires [HuggingFace Llama2-7B-Chat weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) weights. So running this benchmark would assume that you already agreed to the required [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and got verified to download the weights.
2. Running  Llama 2 Chat and Mistral v0.1 instruct with PyTorch on CPU/Metal devices are super slow and goes out of memory with increase in context size. So those are skipped.
3. The PyTorch Benchmark uses [BitsAndBytes library](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/tree/main) to run INT8/4 quantization and running the Llama-2 models.
4. Running Llama 2 Chat and Mistral v0.1 instruct on FP-16/32 is possible on CPU/Metal. However it takes too much memory and is super slow. So we skipped that.
