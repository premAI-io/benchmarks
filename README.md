## Usage for running scripts to get performance info

the runscripts are now going to be outdated I am still keeping them around as they are useful for reference.

### tinygrad

We provide custom script to run inference, and require providing path to MODEL_DIR to ensure correct handling of model setup.
The script should report average time in tokens/sec.

Note: doesn't require a quantized model it just performs dynamic quantization to when loading weights.

Also: All scripts may require a `chmod +x` if they are being executed, after cloning.

```sh
source ./src/setup/tinygrad.sh
# set QUANTIZE=0 to not use int8 quantization
# mac m1 and beyond defaults to "METAL" backend
# use CPU=1 to use CPU backend
QUANTIZE=1 MODEL_DIR="<path/to/llama2-7b-model>" ./src/run/tinygrad.sh "prompt"
```

### burn

Doesn't support quantization, and can be a bit buggy with backends other than torch.
This is the least properly tested pipeline atm. (lmk of any bugs)

```sh
./src/setup/burn.sh # clone llama2-burn into /tmp/llama2-burn
# converts the model to burn model
# provide the model dir and model tokenizer to be converted
# eg: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b
# and also a model name for specifying what converted model binary name
BASE_MODEL_DIR="<model-dir>" BASE_MODEL_TOKENIZER="<model-dir>/tokenizer.model" MODEL_NAME="llama-2-7b-burn" ./src/convert/burn.sh
# run the actual model
# n_toks is 100 by default
MODEL_NAME="llama-2-7b-burn" MODEL_TOKENIZER="<model-dir>/tokenizer.model" PROMPT="prompt" DEVICE_TYPE="cpu" ./src/run/burn.sh
```

### llama.cpp

```sh
```

### candle

The code for candle is largely inspired from huggingface libraries itself, it should automatically download and run the correct model.
Only CPU is supported on M1 atm.
(this is wip, I might break some stuff behind the scenes am working it still, should be stable in a day or two)

```sh
cd ./src/custom/llama_candle
# n tokens and etc can be passed as flags as well,
# use --help to know more
cargo run --features accelerate --release -- --which 7bq8 --prompt "prompt"
```

### TODO: Operator-based performance benchmarking

This is a much rougher but arguably more represenatative example of inference engine performance,
using just a single operator across different engines.
