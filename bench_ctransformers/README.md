[CTransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) is a python binding for some popular transformer models implemented in C/C++ using the [GGML library](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml). CTransformers provides support across CUDA, CPU and Metal. This library also provides very similar [huggingface-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) like interface, which makes it easier to use and integrate in various applications.


## ðŸš€ Running the CTransformers Benchmark.

We can run the CTransformers benchmark for two models: [Llama2-chat](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF) and [Mistral-7B v0.1-instruct](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF) Here is how we run benchmark for CTransformers.

```bash
./bench_ctransformers/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_ctransformers/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_ctransformers/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).

## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note, we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from [HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights](/bench_pytorch/) as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output with `int4` of AutoAWQ. This is our system prompt.

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. Since, ctransformers only supports quantized model. So it does not have benchmarking for float32/16.
2. You can not specify GPU device, rather you have to specify the number of [GPU Layers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers?tab=readme-ov-file#gpu).
3. The device support for CTransformer is model specific. For example, Llama 2 supports CUDA/Metal/CPU, but models like Falcon or MPT only runs on CUDA. You can check out the model support [here](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models).
