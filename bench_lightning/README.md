[Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt) is a hackable implementation of [different Open Source LLMs](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt?tab=readme-ov-file#-lit-gpt-1). Lit-GPT is written using the [Lightning Fabric](https://lightning.ai/docs/fabric/stable/) framework. Lightning Fabric is a fast and lightweight way to scale PyTorch models. It comes with features that enables to do distributed training and inference with ease. Lightning Fabric is based on [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/starter/introduction.html).


## ðŸš€ Running the PyTorch Lightning (LitGPT) Benchmark.

We can run the PyTorch Lightning benchmark for two models: [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) and [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) Here is how we run benchmark for PyTorch Lightning.

```bash
./bench_lightning/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_lightning/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_lightning/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).


## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note. we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output in other three precisions, i.e. `float16`, `int8` and `int4`. This is our system prompt.

Is there anything else I can help | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction through the simultaneous detonation of a fission bomb and a fusion reaction, creating a chain reaction of nuclear reactions that would release an enormous amount of energy. This idea was later developed into the hydrogen bomb.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction through the simultaneous detonation of a fission bomb and a fusion reaction, creating a chain reaction of nuclear reactions that would release an enormous amount of energy.

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. This implementation runs Llama-2-7B models. Lit-GPT model implementation requires converting HuggingFace models to lit-gpt formats. The model conversion can be found in the [setup.sh](/bench_lightning/setup.sh) file.
2. Since, running this benchmark requires [HuggingFace Llama2-7B weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b). So we would assume that you already agreed to the required [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and got verified to download the weights.
3. When running it on Metal devices, it runs out of memory. Therefore we were not able to do inference on Metal.
4. For CPU, it is just too much slow (> 1 minute). Hence we skipped the benchmarking for CPUs.
