[Optimum-Nvidia](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-nvidia) is a Large Language Model inference library developed by HuggingFace. It leverages the advanced compilation capabilities of [Nvidia's TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) to enhance performance. The library specifically takes advantage of the Float8 format supported on Nvidia's Ada Lovelace and Hopper architectures. It's worth noting that benchmarking for Float8 is not currently included in this implementation, as it is not widely supported in other inference engines or providers.

## ðŸš€ Running the Optimum-Nvidia Benchmark.

We can run the Optimum-Nvidia benchmark for two models: [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) and [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) Here is how we run benchmark for Optimum-Nvidia.

```bash
./bench_optimum_nvidia/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_optimum_nvidia/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_optimum_nvidia/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).


## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note. we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output in other three precisions, i.e. `float16`, `int8` and `int4`. This is our system prompt.

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. Running this benchmark requires [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf). So running this benchmark would assume that you already agreed to the required [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and got verified to download the weights.
2. Optimum Nvidia uses Docker to convert the models into a specific engine format. You can find the weight conversion logic under [setup.sh](/bench_optimum_nvidia/setup.sh) file.
3. Optimum Nvidia only supports CUDA.
4. Current implementation readily supports Float16/32 and FP-8 precision. We do not benchmark FP-8 precision, because that it can not be compared with other frameworks. And, INT8/4 [does not](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-nvidia/issues/26) seem to be supported currently.
