[AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) is a package that is a polished implemementation of the original work [llm-awq](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq) from MIT. AWQ or Activation Aware Quantization is a quantization method which supports 4-bit quantization. It massively increases the inference throughput and decreases the memory requirement of the model at the same time. (For example, according to this [reference](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-Chat-AWQ), Llama2 70B requires 2 x 80 GB but with AutoAWQ it can be run on 1 x 48 GB GPU). You can learn more about AWQ on the research paper and the github implementations.

## ðŸš€ Running the AutoAWQ Benchmark.

We can run the AutoAWQ benchmark for two models: [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-AWQ) and [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-AWQ) Here is how we run benchmark for AutoAWQ.

```bash
./bench_autoawq/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_autoawq/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_autoawq/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).

## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note, we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from [HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights](/bench_pytorch/) as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output with `int4` of AutoAWQ. This is our system prompt.

| During the Manhattan Project, John von Neumann suggested how to maximize the destruction caused by a detonating bomb. Which was his idea? Answer as much precise as possible with one sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which involved using nuclear fission to create a chain reaction that would release a massive amount of energy from a single, critical mass of fissile material, leading to an unprecedented level of destruction.                                                                                 | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction through the simultaneous detonation of a fission bomb and a fusion reaction, creating a chain reaction of nuclear reactions that would release an enormous amount of energy. This idea was later developed into the hydrogen bomb.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. AutoAWQ is not supported devices other than GPU (only supports when CUDA is available).
2. We are independently benchmarking AutoAWQ (i.e. the actual AWQ quantization method here). We are not benchmarking with combinations like: AutoAWQ + VLLM or AutoAWQ + TensorRT.
3. AutoAWQ does not support INT8 quantization properly yet. See [this issue](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ/issues/45) and [this PR](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ/pull/71)
