[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-performance library designed for efficient language model (LLM) inference and serving. With a focus on speed, it incorporates state-of-the-art features such as PagedAttention for memory management, continuous batching, and optimized CUDA kernels. It supports various models like LLama, Falcon etc. It is very much flexible and also supports different decoding methods, tensor, distributed inference etc.


## ðŸš€ Running the vLLM Benchmark.

We can run the vLLM benchmark for two models:

- [Llama2 7B Chat AWQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-AWQ) for `int4-float16` mixed precision and  [Llama2 7B Chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) for `float16` and `float32` precision.

-  [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct AWQ](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-AWQ) for `int4-float16` mixed precision and [Mistral-7B v0.1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) for `float16` and `float32` precision.

Here is how we run benchmark for vLLM.

```bash
./bench_vllm/bench.sh \
  --prompt <value> \               # Enter a prompt string
  --max_tokens <value> \           # Maximum number of tokens to output
  --repetitions <value> \          # Number of repititions to be made for the prompt.
  --device <cpu/cuda/metal> \      # The device in which we want to benchmark.
  --model_name <name-of-the-model> # The name of the model. (options: 'llama' for Llama2 and 'mistral' for Mistral-7B-v0.1)
```

To get started quickly you can simply run:

```bash
./bench_vllm/bench.sh -d cuda -n llama
```

This will take all the default values (see in the [bench.sh](/bench_vllm/bench.sh) file) and do the benchmarks for Llama 2 and Mistral models. You can find all the benchmarks results for Llama 2 7B Chat [here](/docs/llama2.md), and Mistral 7B instruct [here](/docs/mistral.md).

## ðŸ’Ž Quality Checks

Please note. we consider the outputs from the raw (float32 precision) from HuggingFace Transformers (PyTorch backend) weights as our ground truth. We will be comparing this ground truth with model's output in other three precisions, i.e. `float16`, `int8` and `int4`. This is our system prompt.

> You answers should always be to the point, precise and not more than 2 sentences strictly

This idea was intended to prevent the enemy from using nuclear reactors as a weapon by rendering them inoperable.                                   | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction by using the energy released by the fusion of atomic nuclei, rather than the fission of a single nucleus, as in the traditional atomic bomb. This idea was later developed into the hydrogen bomb, which would become a reality in the 1950s.            | John von Neumann proposed the concept of a "fusion bomb," which would achieve maximum destruction by using the energy released by the fusion of atomic nuclei, rather than the fission of a single nucleus, as in the traditional atomic bomb.

## ðŸ‘€ Some points to note:

1. Running this benchmark requires [HuggingFace Llama2-7B weights](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b). So running this benchmark would assume that you already agreed to the required [terms and conditions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and got verified to download the weights.
2. vLLM Does not support CPU (check [this](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/176) issue) and Metal devices (check [this](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/1441) issue).
3. Current implementation of vLLM uses [AWQ quantizatized model](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm?tab=readme-ov-file#about) to benchmark Llama2 on INT-4 precision under vLLM.
4. vLLM does not support INT8 currently. See this [issue](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/1508).
